# 100 Days of ML

Here, I am documenting my ML journey from scratch every day. I will start from the basics and add a file each day to solidify my understanding of machine learning concepts.

For the next two weeks, I will go through the initial steps and basic concepts, working on one small task every day. This will help me build a strong foundation in machine learning, one day at a time.

Please go through the initial steps from scratch to follow along with my journey.
